# README Generator

## Description

My motivation for this was to learn a little bit more and gain a experience using node.js. I built this project to help me in the future with creating readme files. This project is looking to make creating readmes a simple console input program and allow me to streamline the readme building process. I learned a lot about inquirer and destructuring, which has been exciting to see the results!

## Installation

In order to run this project you'll need to run these commands in the console with the directory pointing to the installation folder: First,  'npm init-y' and 'npm i' to grab the inquirer package.

## Usage

If installed correctly, upon running 'node index.js', you will be prompted with descriptive questions addressing your project. After answering these questions, the program will then generate a readme following pre-set guidelines to create a clean, and professional README page.
